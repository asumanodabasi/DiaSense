# ğŸ§  AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction and Management System  

> ğŸ“£ This project was developed as part of my Computer Engineering graduation thesis.  



### ğŸ“Œ Project Overview

This system predicts the risk of diabetes using user health data through a machine learning model and provides real-time data management via a user-friendly web interface.

The AI model is built using **LightGBM**, and is integrated into the project via a **Python Flask API**, consumed by an **ASP.NET Core MVC** application.

### ğŸ”§ Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core MVC  
- Entity Framework Core  
- SignalR (real-time updates)  
- Identity (authentication & authorization)  
- SMTP (email notifications)  
- SOLID Principles  
- Layered Architecture  
- Python + Flask API  
- LightGBM Machine Learning Model

---
ğŸ§ª Example Usage
-User logs in via Identity

-Inputs health metrics (e.g., glucose, age, BMI)

-Data sent to Flask API

-AI returns risk prediction

-Result is shown & chart updates live via SignalR

-Forgot Password for email notification sent via SMTP
